NAME
	fft - fast Fourier transform

SYNOPSIS
	#include "fft.h"

	int	fft(double complex *const buf, size_t const n);

DESCRIPTION
	Header-only naive implementation of the fast Fourier transform
	algorithm.

	Requires C99, specifically complex.h.

RETURN VALUES
	Returns 0 on success, and -1 on error.

EXAMPLES
	View example.c, which can be built with GCC using `make example`.

ERRORS
	fft() can fail with the following error:

	EINVAL	Given n was not a power of two. You can pad with zeroes to avoid
		this error.

NOTES
	By default, fft.h includes the libraries it needs. To remove the
	libraries included by fft.h define FFT_NO_INCLUDES.

	Unless FFT_NO_INCLUDES is defined, fft() uses math.h. In which case you
	may need to link with -lm.

	By default, fft() is declared `extern`. To have fft() be declared
	`static`, define FFT_PRIVATE.

SEE ALSO
	The FFTW library provides an optimal implementation of the fast Fourier
	transform algorithm.
